            <h1>Grilled Grapefruit Paloma</h1>
            <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Canola or vegetable oil, for the grill grates</li>
                <li>2 medium ruby red grapefruits, sliced in half</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon granulated sugar</li>
                <li>2 medium limes</li>
                <li>1 cup (8 ounces) reposado tequila</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tablespoons agave</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon smoked salt, optional</li>
                <li>Ice, for serving</li>
                <li>1 to 1 1/2 cups (8 to 12 ounces) club soda</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Instructions:</h2>
            <p>
                <strong class="step">1. Prepare the grill:</strong><br>Prepare the coals and preheat your charcoal grill to medium-high heat (about 400°F), ensuring the grates are clean. Once hot, moisten a clean, folded paper towel with oil and use tongs to grasp it. Lightly oil the grates with the paper towel.<br>
                <strong class="step">2. Grill the grapefruit:</strong><br>Once the grill is almost done preheating, sprinkle each cut side of the grapefruit with 1/2 teaspoon of sugar.Add the grapefruit to the grill, cut side down, and grill until the fruit is juicy and the sugar has caramelized, about 4 minutes. Remove from the grill to a plate and set in the fridge to cool.<br>
                <strong class="step">3. Begin mixing the drinks:</strong><br>Slice the limes in half and squeeze them until you get 1/4 cup (2 ounces) of juice. Reserve the lime half with the most juice left.Add the squeezed lime juice to a small pitcher, followed by the tequila and agave. Stir until the agave dissolves.<br>
                <strong class="step">4. Prepare the glasses:</strong><br>Add the smoked salt to a small plate or shallow bowl. Use the reserved squeezed lime half to moisten one edge of 4 high-ball or similar glasses.Dip each moistened rim in the smoked salt. Fill each glass 2/3 full with ice.<br>
                <strong class="step">5. Assemble the drinks:</strong><br>Divide the mixture evenly between the glasses and top each with 1/4 cup (2 ounces) of club soda, or to taste. Garnish with a piece of grapefruit and serve immediately.<br>
